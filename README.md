# Page Presence

This is a small proof of concept on how one can show on a page a list of active users, and their location on the page.

The data is hard-coded for demo purposes.

The idea is to render the avatar next to the header at the corresponding section or in one of the Presence "parking spot", and animate between them.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
